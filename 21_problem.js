// Create a function called 'fullName' that takes the first part of your name and the last part of your name as parameters. And it will return your full name as the output by concatenating the two parts of your name. For example, given hablu and kanto as input parameters, hablu will return kanto as output.

function fullName(firstName,lastName) {
    var myName = (`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
    return myName;

console.log(fullName("vallabh","tripathi"))
